 This directory contains two Python programs which are the solutions to the post training test question. These programs include a To-Do List application and a Fibonacci series generator.

## To-Do List Application

### Description
The To-Do List application is a simple command-line program that enables users to manage tasks. Users can add tasks, list tasks, and remove tasks from the list.

### Setup
1. Make sure you have Python and PostgreSQL installed on your system.
